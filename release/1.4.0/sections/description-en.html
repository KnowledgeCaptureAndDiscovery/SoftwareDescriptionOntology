We use sd:Software as a general concept that refers to any piece of software we may want to describe. Software may refer to one or more sd:SoftwareVersions, which represent the evolution of a software across time. Software versions are a type of software which is important to describe independently when reporting scientific results, as otherwise the results may differ from previous executions with another software version. Versions may be associated with one or more sd:SoftwareConfigurations. Software configurations represent a unique executable function of a particular software. For example, given the Scikit-learn software, a software configuration would include a primitive invocation that imputes a target dataset. Software configurations are key to appropriately capturing heterogeneous functions in complex software libraries that can be used for multiple purposes (e.g., dataset analysis and creating visualizations of results), and therefore represent metadata on how a software is invoked.

Software configurations also link to the expected structure (sd:DatasetSpecification) of those inputs (sd:hasInput) and outputs (sd:hasOutput) necessary either to invoke or a product of a software. Dataset specifications capture critical metadata such as the format of an expected input and the variables it may contain (sd:VariablePresentation). Examples of variables include the number of citizens in a city from a census file used to visualize a map, the precipitation measurement used to create a weather report or the predicted value of a machine learning analysis. Most software uses a structured format to read data from the inputs and serialize the output. By capturing the expected contents of inputs and outputs, we can relate different software configurations in terms of the expected variables they use and produce, instead of file formats like CSV or NetCDF. Software using generic functions on variables (e.g., calculating the average of a column in a file) may be described using anonymous variables.

Different software configurations may use different identifiers to refer to their variable presentations. For instance, a climate model may expect a CSV file with a column named “PREC” to refer to precipitation. Other software may use “P” to refer to the same concept. Fortunately, different scientific communities adopt naming standards, such as CF  in the climate community or the Scientific Variables Ontology in geosciences, which facilitate grouping identical variables. We include the term sd:StandardVariable in order to help conflate different variables together.
